00:00:01	hello everyone my name is Abhishek and welcome back to my channel so today we'll take a look at the episode 3 of shell scripting series that we are doing and in this in this video we'll talk about shell scripting interview questions so if you are new to my channel and haven't followed the past two videos where we talked about cell scripting Basics as well as intermediate level uh I would highly recommend you to go and watch those videos because uh if you directly jump onto the interview questions you might not completely

00:00:28	understand it so what's the basics what's the intermediate level and then come here and in the future we'll also do a couple of videos on Advanced shell scripting but before that I want everybody to come onto the same page and you know people get enough time to watch my first two videos and practice themselves and then you know we can go to the advanced section okay so without wasting any time so today I'm here with some 20 questions and these 20 questions have gathered from various sources and

00:00:56	from my past experiences and trust me these are the most commonly asked questions so whenever you are going for a shell scripting interview so you can definitely expect a few questions from this and uh we'll try to understand these questions as detailed as possible so the first question there is a reason why I put this question as a first one so whenever you are doing a shell scripting interview what happens is the interviewer always tries to understand what do you know about cell scripting or what is your common understanding or do

00:01:28	you use it in a day-to-day basis or not so whenever somebody asks you this question list some most commonly used shell commands so the first thing that you have to do is be very honest and tell what are the commands that you use day to day basis like you know what are the commands people should regularly use is the ls command to list the files people use some commands like uh you know the copy command the move command people use uh mkdr to create directory so touch command to create files Vim command to open the files grip to filter

00:02:00	the command so only talk about these commands the reason why I'm saying is I've seen people answering uh something like okay on a day-to-day basis I use netcat I use comments like route I use commands like Trace root but trust me these are the commands which you use only when you are into issues right only when you want to debug something so firstly start with the comments and be honest and explain that okay I use cell scripting for listing the files and for that I use the ls command uh usually we have to find

00:02:33	some files on a Linux machine so for that we use the find command and you know you can say that we usually debug the Linux machine so we use some debugging commands like top command or SAR command or you can say that we look for the disk spaces so we use the DF command so you tell about the comments that use regularly because most of the times all the companies uh employees use these common commands and the command select trace route or the commands like netcat are only used when there are issues or

00:03:06	when you have to debug machine so say that these are the commands that I frequently use and there are some additional commands like whatever the advanced commands that you want to mention okay so this is about the question number one and then this question number two that we have is write a simple shell script to list all the process so this is a very easy command and you know this is something that people use day to day basis so the purpose of asking this question is do you really use your uh day to day or you know do you

00:03:36	regularly work on a Linux machine or not so to identify the list of processes if you watch our previous videos you can simply do PS hyphen EF so PS hyphen EF will list all the processes and it will also provide information of all the processes like you know uh there is a go process that is running on my machine there is a zsh process that is running on my machine there is Bash process of course running on my machine so these are the things and you know once you explain about this command like psf and EF they might ask you okay so

00:04:05	psyphen EF is giving a lot of things I just want the process ID which is like you know this one so just print me the process ID so for that in our previous videos I explained you like just take example of one command here or the one output here so let's say that this is one of the process that is running and this is the entire information of the process right so when they are asking you to only print the process ID you need to understand that you know this is a line and this line has one two three four

00:04:34	five six seven eight strings and they are specifically asking you to print the second string or column number two so what do we have to do I also explained this in the previous video but you can make sure I mean you can use the awk command OC is basically used to filter the output of a specific line or a specific uh file or whatever you want to so I can use org and I can say the field separator what is the field separator in this case I mean who is what is separating a string from a string that is a white space so simply

00:05:05	within the double quote use a space okay followed by use a dollar and uh sorry use a single quote and inside the brackets just say print what is the column that you want to print column number two so it will directly print you all the process IDs so that's it it's a simple question and this question can be extended uh just like what I have shown you after that write a script to print only errors from a remote log so this is again something that is really important because let's say all your logs are

00:05:39	getting stored in a Google storage or let's say all your logs are getting stored in an S3 bucket so you can get the entire log using the API call or you can use a how do you use how do you retrieve logs or how do you retrieve any information uh from a remote server or a remote machine in cell script using the call command so we already discussed about the curl so using curl what you can do is you can get the entire output of the file but the thing that you have to do is instead of getting the entire output

00:06:10	they are asking you only to print the error message so for that what you can do is like I have also shown you previously you can simply say uh let's say I have a remote file uh for example curl google.com so this is just an example okay so when I say call google.com this is the output that I got now let's say they only want me to print the this specific line okay or they just want me to print herf okay href H reference okay so what I need to do is after the call command I can simply use a pipe followed

00:06:44	by the grip command to print the specific line that I want let's say in this case assume this is an error message line so what you can say is simply grab HF and what happens is you get that file only ignore about this this part uh this thing here okay so just ignore this one this is just the output that we are receiving but this is how you retrieve a specific line or specific set of lines from the remote machine whether it's a log file whether it is any other file this is how you retrieve it and for your example if you

00:07:14	want me to show a specific log file also I just uploaded a log file the other day uh on to one of my git repositories you can also use this one for your practice so this is a Sandbox repository that I have and so this is the dummy log file that I stored so just click on this log file so here you can see a log file right so this is just a dummy log file that I just stored for our students example purpose so here if you see there is info log there is tracing log and even in your real-time use case this will be how I mean this is

00:07:47	how your log file looks like so let's say I just want to print the trace logs okay so there are a lot of infrola info logs but I only want to read the trace logs so instead of going through the file and reading this hundred thousand lines of file what I can simply do is I can say curl followed by just get the URL of the file and followed by grep p r a c because we want to get the trace file and here we have all the trace file what you can now do is you can simply copy this into a file and you can share

00:08:16	this output to your colleagues or whoever is requesting this information now in an interview what you will say I can simply get this output using the combination of curl what are the three different commands you are using here you are using curl just go back to the command we are using the graph and also we are using the pipe so that's why we will say you can achieve this by using curl pipe and grip okay there is a significance for each and every command here so what is curl doing curl is retrieving the output or curl is getting

00:08:44	your entire log file what is grip doing grep is only getting a section of output that you want like if you want error then it is only getting error but what is pipe doing pipe is combining this command with this command Okay so let's say that there is no pipe here okay so if there is no pipe what happens is you you are getting you are getting the log file here and you are using the grip command but without pipe there is no use see what happened it sent you the entire file not just the trace and after that it said could not

00:09:17	resolve the host grip and could not resolve the host Trace that means it is not understanding the next command that you entered so the grip Trace is something that it is not understanding so for the compiler to understand you have to use the pipe command and what pipe does is it will send the output of your entire First Command to the second command okay that's how you retrieve only the trace level logs or if you want to just get the error you can just change it to error perfect so this is how it works we got

00:09:44	all the error logs here so isn't it very easy so just you need to practice these commands after that write a shell script to print members divided by three and five and not 15. okay so for your purpose what I have done is I have slightly complicated this question so there are many forms of this question like people might ask you like an interview can ask interviewer can ask you print even numbers okay or they can say print odd numbers print numbers divisible by 3 or people can ask you print prime

00:10:22	number so all of them are same category questions okay don't worry like the only reason why I have these questions are uh you know I just combined this question so that you understand everything like I don't want to just say uh print even numbers or print odd numbers or print divisible by three so instead I just combine multiple questions and I framed a single question so that please save time some we save some time as well so the approach is same let's say you have to print even numbers what you will do you will check if the number

00:10:50	is divisible by 2. for odd numbers you will just say not divisible by 2 that's it right so you just need to understand the approach okay and similarly here if you try to understand the question let's break the question into multiple parts and finally we will try to put this script I mean this will try to put this entire thing into a shell script okay we'll write that as well so firstly what is the question so the question is divided into three parts divisible by 3 divisible by Phi and not divisible by

00:11:30	15 okay so there are three parts the first part is the number has to be divisible by three the second part is number has to be divisible by 5 and the final part is number should not be divisible by 15. now why did I choose this one then let's try to understand the question so what is the multiple and multiple of three and five let's say uh you have you are given numbers from 1 to 15 okay so what are the numbers that are divisible by 3 you have three you have six you have nine you have 12 and you

00:11:59	have fifteen and similarly for Phi what will be the numbers the numbers will be 5 10 and 15. so what my question is trying to do is print me these numbers print me these numbers but just exclude 15. okay so this is slightly tricky but we will be able to achieve it in a simple way I'll show you how to achieve it and let's also learn how to write this kind of scripts in a step-by-step manner no you will ask interviewer immediately the question write a shell script to print numbers divided by three and five

00:12:32	so we'll ask you uh I mean you will ask the interviewer from how many for how for how much range do you want me to print like do you want me to print for the numbers between 1 and 100 or 100 000 or do you want me to create a custom range of numbers so let's say interviewer said okay print numbers divided by 3 and 5 and not divisible by 15 from 1 to 100 okay so now let's take this into a shell script so let me call sample script dot sh okay so firstly what we will always do is we'll use a shebang and

00:13:06	we'll say slash bin slash Bash after that what we will do we'll provide the information of the script right now I am not doing to just save the time so for you what you can do is you can put all the details of your script that you are writing here who is the author what is the information what is the script what is it trying to do just provide all this information after that okay I'm skipping that part what you will try to do is you will try to break down the question as I just explained you because

00:13:30	whenever you are writing a script in the in an interview interviewer has to understand your mind right you just can't simply start writing the code but just explain him while writing what you will say is okay I understood your question and my Approach would be the number has to be divisible by divisible by 3 divisible by Phi and you will explain him that it should not be divisible by 3 times of Phi that is 15 okay so that's what you will explain him that means in my script what I'll do is I'll make sure the number is divided by

00:14:03	15 oh sorry divided by 3 divided by 5 and not divided by 15. so this will be my logic now after this what you will do is you'll start writing the script so first of all to write the script you got an input from the interviewer that the number range has to be 1 to 100 but instead of writing the entire thing in a single command what you will do is you will break down so firstly let's write the if command okay because what we have identified is firstly the number has to be divided by three this is a condition

00:14:32	right what is this this is a if condition and again this is another if condition right we have two if conditions here and finally we have one notif condition and we have a for Loop because the range is already explained so the interviewer told you the range is 1 to 100 so we can use a for Loop perfect so you have this information as well so firstly let's start with the if if what you will say inside the square brackets what you want to do is you want to say that the expression okay so expression

00:15:12	percentile let's say the number is I okay I should be divided by 2 or it should be the percentage of this number should be equals to 0 okay so that's why what you will mention is if expression of I percentile percentile sorry I percentile 2 equals to equals to 0 okay in such case you will simply say that then Echo dollar of I perfect and finally we'll close the if block uh sorry my bad here you should say if I percentile percentile 3 okay because our first condition is to verify if the number is divided by 3 or not are you

00:15:54	clear with this now let's extend this one okay what is our second condition divisible by five so what you have to do is just put a or condition and just copy the entire thing here just paste it and instead of three replace it with five okay now you have complicated the condition and you said the number has to be divisible by 3 divisible by 5 and if this condition is matching if one of these condition is matching because we are using the or condition what happens if you are using and condition both the

00:16:25	X both this condition I mean both this expression and this expression have to be true but because it can be 3 or it can be 5 divisible by 3 or divisible by 5 we'll use a or condition here perfect now we did this as well but we are left with one final condition that is the number has to be not divisible by 15 okay so for that reason what you will say is Ampersand ampersand let's copy the same condition okay and here what I'll say is percentile 15 not equals to zero okay so this condition has one or condition and one

00:17:06	and condition okay so the number has should I mean the number should always be not divisible by 15 but it can be divisible it can be divisible by 3 and it can be or it can be divisible by five okay so that is the condition here right it can either be a multiple of three it can either be a multiple of five but it should not be a multiple of 15 in both the cases so that's why I use the and condition here and for this one I use the or condition perfect now you wrote the script but who will Define the range so for that what

00:17:38	we need to do is above this you have to define a range how do you define a range using a for Loop say for I in okay 1 200 do this is the condition that you are doing and finally you will say done because your condition is done so inside the for Loop this is the conditions that you are applying so that's why this is your for Loop statement this is the condition and finally you are closing your for Loop so this will be your script now let's save this one let us say CH mode triple seven like I always say in your real time do

00:18:15	not use triple seven use only the uh parameter or the permission that is required okay now let me try to execute this one sample script.sh and what will happen it will return uh if you see here let's see from the starting three is available 5 is available 6 is available because this is uh divisible by three divisible by five again three again three five 12 is there but there is no 15 the reason is we have skipped the 15 or we have skipped the multiples of 15 even if you see here 90 number 90 is not available 87 and 93

00:18:52	are available right so that's the condition that we have executed if we look at the script one more time we say the script or the number should be multiples of three multiples of 5 but it should not be multiple of 15 okay now because you understood how do you how do you write this scripts what you can do is you can try by yourself for even numbers odd numbers you can also try for multiple of uh six multiple of seven whatever you want you can just improve the script and you can try it at your end

00:19:22	perfect after that write a script to print number of s in Mississippi okay there is no reason why I choose Mississippi Mississippi is slightly a complicated word and most of the times people use uh this word itself I mean most of the interviews also I have seen so you can change it with anything you can say Singapore okay or you can choose any word you can choose your name and you can try to print one of the alphabet occurrence so the script what it is trying to say is the number of occurrence of s in Mississippi it's

00:19:53	like if you see here there is two there are two SC here and there is one more scr and one more s here so the output should output should be 4 and what if the interviewer is giving the word called Singapore the output output should be one because there is only one s I hope you understood the question and now let's try to write this script as well Vim let me call this as number dot sh okay so the script is again very simple don't worry about the thing uh we'll start with as always we'll start with shebang slash

00:20:26	bin slash bash now there are multiple ways to do this thing uh like always whenever you are doing a scripting people do it in their own ways people try to be very creative but in an interview always start with the basics okay so the interviewer should not feel that you don't know the basic way of doing it or you don't know the uh like you know the easy way of doing it so always say that this is the easy way of doing it and if you want I can improve the efficiency or you can say that I can do it in a much better way but if you

00:20:56	ask me uh like this is a very simple command to achieve this one because you are not doing any programming right you are just doing a command here let's say you are doing a programming then I agree that you know your time complexity will come into picture and all of the other things but because you are just doing or just you are talking about a simple shell command so that's why I say that okay whenever you ask me this one I can simply do the grip command and find it but if you want I can also uh you know

00:21:21	use some Advanced approach or you use an efficient way of doing it so the output here is very simple firstly Define the word let's call this as X and let's say x is equals to m i s s i ssipi I hope the spelling is right uh so how we will achieve this is just say grab and in grip there is a command called minus o or hyphen o which will stand for only okay what you are trying to grip you are only trying to get for a alphabet called s even if it is Singapore or even if it is Mississippi you are only trying to

00:21:53	grip for an alphabet called s followed by three lesser than symbols which I which we'll talk now dollar of x x is nothing but Mississippi that you define here and finally you will say word count minus L what this command is doing is it is sending all the 4S to this one and in here what we are doing is we are trying to count the words okay so word count command is nothing but let's say you have a file and somebody asks you that what is the length of this file or how many number of lines are present in this file so in

00:22:25	such cases you can simply use the word count command and say that okay uh cat name of the file pipe word count minus l so word count minus L is always used to return the number of lines so here what we are doing is we are trying to redirect the output of this into a standard input and this standard input is passed to the grip command Okay so on a first side you might find it complicated but this is very very easy we are just using the grip command to only filter or you know only uh get the output of single alphabet that is s and

00:22:57	we are trying to send this uh Mississippi into a standard input to this command and finally we are trying to get the word count okay okay so what you need to do here is you have to practice these things okay only with practice you can achieve these kind of things pause this video here try to understand what I've done and finally you will uh you know Master this art so the output is four if you change uh the name here let's say I'll change this to Singapore okay so if I change this to Singapore what will happen

00:23:27	the output should be 1 because there is only one s here that's it so this is so simple uh only thing is you have to just Master it every day okay how will you debug the shell script Nothing uh the command is very simple whenever you start writing your shell script what you need to do is you have to do SCT minus X that is set minus X so for any script if you just add your first line as set minus X then your cell script will run in debug mode or you can able to troubleshoot your cell script you we already saw that on our previous

00:23:59	videos what is Chrome tab in Linux can you provide example usage okay so basically cront tab is nothing but uh let's say you are a Linux administrator okay so URL Linux admin so as a Linux admin your job your roles and responsibilities are every day at 6 PM you have to send a report okay what report you have to send let's say you have to send the report of node health Javier node is performing or what is the CPU says what is the RAM usage instead of every day you go and log in at 6 pm and execute a specific script what you

00:24:33	can do is you can make use of Chrome tab cron tab is nothing but it's like an alarm or it's like uh you know every day you just set your Chrome tab to 6 pm and Linux will automatically execute your script at 6 pm and give you the output whether you want to store it in S3 bucket or you want to store in a specific folder of a file you can do that using Chrome tab that's it so the question is very simple and the answer is also very simple do not try to complicate such kind of questions now how do you open a file in a readme

00:25:01	mode so uh read-only mode okay so usually how do you open a file you use Vim command or use a VM command so how do you how do you use it like you say Vim test dot txt or vimtest.sh or something right so instead what you can do is you can just say hyphen R so that the file will be just opened in the readme mode or read-only mode sorry not read me read only what is the difference between soft and hard link okay so this is one of the most asked questions so just pay attention to what I'm saying this is not complicated but you have to

00:25:36	understand this uh so that you explain this in a better way to the interviewer so in Linux there are two links one is softlink and one is hard link so what are these links so let's say uh what happens when you create a file okay let's say that you create a file or you just try to save a file okay create a file and save a file what happens in this case whenever you create a file and save a file this gets saved in the memory right where is get where is this getting saved this is getting saved in a memory

00:26:06	or on the disk so what happens is let's say you want to reuse this file multiple times okay you want to create a copy of this file okay or you want to just uh I mean take a copy of this file and modify this file in such cases you can use hard links okay so instead of copying this command all that I'm using CP command or you know uh just copying the content of the file into a different command you can just create a hard link to this specific file uh I'm not explaining about the syntax of this hard

00:26:39	link it is nothing but you can simply use the Ln command that's not complicated but you need to understand the concept here so using hard link what you can do is you can create copy or you can mirror a specific file okay so what happens here is even if your original file gets deleted let's say you have a secret file and your secret file should not be deleted because you have some sensitive information what you can do is you can create a hard link of the file what happens is it will create a copy

00:27:03	hard link will create a copy so even if the actual file is deleted from the memory your copy still exists and your hard link will keep a backup of your file but soft links are not like that the best example for soft link is let's say you have Python 3 installed on your machine OK so you will always see there is a Python 3 file and there is always there is also a python file what this python does is whenever you are executing dot slash python okay so your Linux terminal will send this output to Python 3 because the python has a soft

00:27:34	link to python3 that's it so what is the difference between hard link and soft link if you are deleting Python 3 or if you're deleting python because both of them are referencing to the same point in the memory both the files are deleted okay so soft links are like that why you use soft links is basically for this kind of things like creating Alias files or instead of every time you type python3 you can create a soft link for Python 3 called Python and you can just say Okay use Python so these kind of

00:28:00	things this is just an example so always explain your interviews in terms of examples then what is the difference between break and continuous statements in a loop again this is uh quite commonly asked questions break continue okay so the words itself will explain you the answer I don't have to explain it completely because the words are self-informative what is break break is nothing but you are breaking the execution continue is nothing but okay you are continuing the execution okay so the thing is the continue comes with

00:28:37	a special condition called skip so it is instead of continue you have to understand it as skip this and continue the next okay so it is very simple let's say you are doing a for Loop okay and in the for Loop we'll take the same example that we discussed okay the number has to be divided by three the number has to be divided by 5 but if the number is divided by 3 and 5 that is if it is a multiple of 3 and 5 that is 15 you have to ignore okay so what you can do in the for Loop is instead of the way

00:29:09	that we wrote previously you can say Okay has to be divided by three perfect has to be divided by 5 but if it is divided by 15 just ignore so instead of ignore what you will say is just continue the iteration similarly break is nothing but break you use when let's say you have a complicated for Loop and this for Loop is executing between numbers one to one crore okay or just let's assume n number of zeros okay so this script takes almost 10 minutes to execute but what your interviewer says that if I am

00:29:41	finding a number in between okay so I just want Phi okay so the my output is 5 but I want you I want you to Loop through one to this number or my output is 5555 but I want you to look through the entire Loop or find until this number is found okay so for that cases what you will do is you will start looping from 1 to this large number but whenever you find this number you can simply say break okay another example is let's say you have 100 students in your class okay and you have a record of this

00:30:12	100 students okay let's say that you stood all of this 100 students in a CSV file or an Excel sheet okay so in such cases what you will usually do you Loop through all the student names and you will print all the student names but what your interviewer says is once you find a student name called Abhishek okay stop the execution that's all I want okay whenever Abhishek is found I don't want all the people after Abhishek okay so my criteria is just find all the students if Abhishek is in the first

00:30:39	place just print the output as Abhishek if Abhishek is in the third place just print student number one student number two and Abhishek if Abhishek is in 10th position just say student one two three four five six seven eight nine and Abhishek so in such cases you can simply use the continuous state or sorry if the break statement I hope this is clear to you now let's go to the next question okay so this is a tricky question people will ask you what are the disadvantages of shell scripting I think people will

00:31:04	ask you everywhere whenever you are giving any interview like Java interview or python interview so come up with your own answer I have shared some information here don't go with this one try to explain your real-time use cases whenever you are writing shell script what are the disadvantages that you found like you can say one of the example as it's not statically typed that is uh you know you can just declare a variable and even if you are not using it like let's say if you are not defining SCT minus U okay the person has

00:31:32	not used this set minus U command in his script and what happens is even though there are n number of Undeclared variables your shell script will not complain your compiler will not complain so you can explain such kind of use cases which are very practical in nature what are different kinds of loops and when to use I think you already know you have for Loop you have while loop you have do while loop Okay so you can just say that okay there are different types of Loops in Shell scripting and these are the different

00:31:59	kinds of Loops like any programming language uh what is the purpose of each and every Loop so I'm just leaving it to you to identify what are the different types of loops and you know what is the use case for each and every Loop the reason why I'm leaving this to you is because this is a very common question that you will find lot of sources in the interview and we should not waste time on such kind of questions is batch dynamically or statically typed okay so this is uh one more question so the modern day programming languages are

00:32:28	usually uh statically typed like if you take a golang or these kind of things they are statically type but if you look at the programming language like python okay or shell so these are the scripting language like shell they are dynamically typed what do I mean by dynamically typed let's say I am using shell scripting so I can simply do like this right X is equals to Phi or I can say x is equals to string or I can do any other thing but if you are talking about a specific programming language like a go language before you

00:32:57	have to Define like where X is a string okay and if you are providing x with a number you are go language will say that okay The golang Interpreter will say that okay you said X is a string but you have provided integer so I'll terminate the Executioner through an error so the same thing does not apply you can do it with shell as well or python as well but by default the nature is a dynamically typed okay uh people will ask you what are the networking uh troubleshooting tools that you use so one of the best tool that

00:33:31	I'll recommend here is Trace root okay so trace route is a tool that you can use for your uh Network debugging for example I'll show you uh you want to see why your network is slow usually you will go to your internet and you will find some networking tools and you will try to understand why is it slow but the classic way of doing even these modern day tools also use uh these kind of shell commands are the Linux commands underneath so to understand why your network is very slow today what you can

00:33:58	do is you can simply say trace route or trace route followed by google.com so what I am trying to do is I'm trying to reach the google.com let us see what are the number of hops in between your trace route and google.com that is from your laptop it goes to your router from your router it goes to your internet service provider router from there it will take multiple Hops and finally reach google.com so this command will explain you what are the different Hops and how much each hop is taking time okay so

00:34:26	these kind of things you can identify using Trace router so firstly it said okay this is your IP address this is my IP address and let's see where this is going after that it will basically uh go to a specific act corporation that I'm using okay after that it goes to a different IP address I cannot show you the entire details but after I mean for the purpose of security after that it goes to your internet service provider and finally it will reach your google.com and similarly there is one more command called Trace

00:34:52	path so Trace path is also efficient command because using Trace path also you can identify okay Trace path is not installed on my machine but using Trace path also you can identify these things and Trace path does not require root privileges and after that Javier sought list of names in a file so this is not a not at all a complicated question sometimes I have seen interviewers asking this uh silly questions because people think a lot about these things and uh you know they start writing a short uh sort kind

00:35:21	of looping and all the other things but as I already mentioned here whenever you're doing or whenever you are explaining your interview always talk about the easiest way and then you can say okay so sort comes with the nature of time complexity uh o of n or o of n square whatever it is and you can say that okay I can improve the efficiency but first of all the easy way of doing is use the sort command so Linux natively has a command called sort how will you manage logs of a system that generates Huge lot files every day

00:35:48	this is very very important question for Linux administrators and also devops Engineers because as a Linux admin you manage a lot of applications right so each of these applications will definitely omit logs and if your application is a real-time front-end pacing application I mean real-time customer facing application so it will emit 100 000 1000 n number of logs right so how do you preserve all of these logs so if you keep storage of all these logs then what happens your disk gets on increasing and increasing so for that

00:36:20	reason there is an efficient way on Linux that is called log Rotator okay so using log rotate you can basically efficiently manage your Linux machines locks or application logs so about the log rotate command the command is very simple you can just say log rotate and you can Define like for how many days you want to rotate these logs let's say uh for every day once end of your 24 hours you can say that once uh 24 hours is done just zip this log you can also Define the format like you can say gzip

00:36:52	or you can say zip or you can say tar create a compressed version of this ZIP file and say that okay after 30 days if the 30 days has happened just delete the log file okay so these are all the uh commands and these are all some of the most common interview questions that I wanted to explain today if you have any questions don't hesitate uh post the questions in your in the comment section uh as you know I reply to each and every comment uh that I receive on my video and finally don't forget to like

00:37:20	subscribe my channel share this video with your friends and we will do lot more interesting uh Concepts on the shell scripting and also on python in the coming days thank you so much I hope you like the video I'll see you in the next video bye take care
