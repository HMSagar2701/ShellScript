# Common Shell Commands and Useful Bash Scripts

This README provides a collection of useful shell commands, simple bash scripts, and best practices for writing and explaining shell scripts ‚Äî especially handy for interviews or everyday usage.

## Listing Process IDs

**Question:** How do I list all process IDs (PIDs) on a Unix/Linux system?

**Answer:**  
You can use the `ps` command along with `awk` to extract the PID column from the full process listing:

```bash
ps -ef | awk '{print $2}'
````

* `ps -ef` lists all processes with detailed info.
* `awk '{print $2}'` extracts the second column (which is the PID).

---

## Fetching and Filtering Remote Logs

**Question:** How can I download a remote log file and filter it for error lines?

**Answer:**
You can use `curl` to fetch the remote file and pipe it into `grep` to filter:

```bash
curl <REMOTE_LOG_URL> | grep "ERROR"
```

* `curl <REMOTE_LOG_URL>` downloads the log file from the URL.
* `grep "ERROR"` filters and prints only lines containing the word "ERROR".
* The pipe `|` connects the output of `curl` to `grep`.

**Note:** Replace `<REMOTE_LOG_URL>` with your actual log file URL.

## Script: Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5 but Not 15

**Question:** How to print numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 and 5, but not by 15?

**Answer:**
Here's a bash script that does exactly that:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for ((i=1; i<=100; i++)); do
  if [[ $((i % 3)) -eq 0 && $((i % 5)) -eq 0 && $((i % 15)) -ne 0 ]]; then
    echo $i
  fi
done
```

**Explanation:**

* Loop through numbers 1 to 100.
* Check if a number is divisible by 3 (`i % 3 == 0`) and 5 (`i % 5 == 0`) **and** not divisible by 15 (`i % 15 != 0`).
* Print the number if conditions are met.

---

## Best Practices During Interview

* **Explain your thought process** clearly before jumping into code.
* **Ask clarifying questions** about input range or assumptions.
* Use **clear variable names** and add **comments** for readability.
* Mention why you choose specific commands like `grep`, `awk`, or pipes (`|`).
* Be ready to discuss **alternatives or optimizations**.

---

## Common Follow-up Questions

**Q1: How do you make a script executable?**

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

**Q2: How do you schedule this script to run periodically with `cron`?**

* Open cron jobs editor with:

```bash
crontab -e
```

* Add a line like below to run every day at midnight:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/script.sh
```

**Q3: How to save script output to a file or send it via email?**

* Save output to file:

```bash
./script.sh > output.log
```

* Send output via email (using `mail` command):

```bash
./script.sh | mail -s "Script Output" user@example.com
```
